                            Shoppers spend various amounts of time in the grocery store. Some have more time than others to go searching for what they are looking for. If we can create an app where they can organize and keep track of purchases they can shop more efficiently. All shoppers can have an enjoyable and less frustrating time shopping for the goods they want and need.
